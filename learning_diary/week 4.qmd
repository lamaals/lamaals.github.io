## Summary

In this week, we focused on applying remote sensing to accomplish policy objectives. Then we were asked to select a city and identify policy challenges that could be then addressed using remote sensing. I'm really intrigued by the observation and analysis of cities affected by conflict. I believe that by leveraging satellite images we can assess the economic, environmental, and social impact of war, which can help in the decision-making process. Hence, I have chosen to study the impact of war on Ukraine.

As highlighted in the **Sustainable Development Goals** agenda:

**Goal 11:** Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, **resilient** and sustainable.In fact, sustainable development in cities is critical to achieving most of Agenda 2030. [@universa]

## Application

Because of the war on Ukraine the economics of the country has been massively impacted, for the first year of the conflict the GDP of Ukraine saw a devastating 30-35% decline. The deterioration of the economic in Ukraine is one of many side effects of war (other impacts such as displacement, infrastructure damage, pollution, agriculture damage, etc..).

The focus of the new agenda is to prioritize the development of cities that exhibit resilience, environmental sustainability, and economic growth in urban areas. Therefore, it was appropriate to highlight Ukraine, a country in conflict, as a case study.

It is appropriate to use remotely sensed data in this kind of sensitive situation, as it can provide accurate information about it. This was illustrated throw some of studies that was conducted on Ukraine, these studies helped in observing socioeconomic changes, air pollution, infrastructure damage, and aid in the refugee relief operation. For this week I will focus on only one paper while also recommending other remote sensing methods that can aid in studying the impact of war. This paper details the methods used for damage assessment: [***War Related Building Damage Assessment in Kyiv, Ukraine, Using Sentinel-1 Radar and Sentinel-2 Optical Image***]{.underline} [@aimaiti2022].

In this study, medium-resolution satellite imagery was used because it is publicly available and capable of rapidly producing damage maps, which can serve as an initial reference for assessing damage. To focus on urban areas and suppress changes from other features and landcover types, a built-up area mask is generated using OpenStreetMap building footprints and the World Settlement Footprint (WSF) dataset, respectively.

#### Methods

The workflow consists of four phases: data selection and pre-processing, change detection analysis using the log ratio of intensity and Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) methods, determination of an optimal threshold for separating changed and unchanged areas, and validation of results using high-resolution WorldView images and the UNOSAT damage assessment map.

[**SAR Intensity Analysis:**]{.underline}

A collapsed building exhibits a distinct backscatter structure compared to an intact one. Typically, strong backscattering diminishes or disappears after a building collapses due to a disaster. However, in partially damaged buildings, where sections of the wall and roof collapse, remaining walls, debris, and ground may form a corner reflector, resulting in strong double-bounce effects and increased backscattering intensity. This difference enables the identification of damaged and undamaged buildings using SAR backscattering intensity change detection. For this purpose, the study implemented the simple yet robust SAR log ratio of intensity method.

[**Optical Texture Analysis:**]{.underline}

In this study, the GLCM Mean was utilized to differentiate between damaged and undamaged buildings, This feature is particularly valuable for classifying landscapes, especially in building damage assessment. GLCM Mean represents interior texture, characterized by high values in areas with subtle and irregular variations and few coherent edges. Statistics were calculated with a 3 × 3 window size using ENVI software. Initially, the average of pre-event images was computed to create a single pre-event texture image. Subsequently, the texture difference between this image and the post-event texture was calculated. The optimal threshold value for texture difference analysis was determined to be 0.4, with pixels below this threshold classified as damaged.

#### Results

The Sentinel-1 intensity analysis revealed flooding along the Irpin River. This area was excluded from the assessment as the flooding might be an indirect impact of war, but the focus is specifically on war-related damages to buildings and infrastructure. Significant building damage was concentrated in the northwestern part of Kyiv Oblast, particularly in Irpin, Bucha, and Hostomel. Building statistics, ranging from 85 m2 to 74,156 m2, were calculated using augmented OSM polygons and ArcGIS Desktop software. Most buildings identified by SAR intensity analysis were medium to large-scale structures. Smaller residential buildings were poorly detected, likely due to sensor limitations. High-rise buildings were flagged as damaged, but visual assessments using WorldView imagery did not confirm this finding. The WSF mask showed more false positives than the OSM mask.

The damage assessment results from the Sentinel-2 texture analysis revealed a flooded area along the Irpin River, similar to the SAR intensity analysis but with a smaller extent. Four representative areas were selected for comparison using the OSM mask versus the WSF built-up layer mask. The effects of these masks were less significant compared to the SAR intensity analysis, indicating fewer false positives in unmasked damage labels. Comparison with high-resolution WorldView images showed that the texture analysis mainly detected damages on large buildings with clear boundaries. However, buildings with dark roofs and smaller damaged buildings lacking distinct texture features compared to their surroundings were not captured in the analysis. Additionally, changes in intensity values of bright objects, representing either bare ground or tall structures showing different reflectance at different times, were misclassified as damaged buildings.

#### Conclusion

This study utilized Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data to assess damage in Kyiv during the 2022 war. The analysis revealed concentrated damage in the northwestern Kyiv Oblast, particularly in cities like Bucha, Irpin, and Hostomel. When comparing damage detection algorithms, the analysis achieved 58% accuracy compared to UNOSAT verified damage, with 76% accuracy for larger buildings. The use of OpenStreetMap (OSM) and World Settlement Footprint (WSF) masks reduced false positives, but incomplete OSM footprints excluded some damage. Although texture analysis effectively detected large damaged buildings, it was less accurate for identifying small ones. Consequently, the study found that the intensity analysis performed better due to its ability to identify a wider range of building sizes accurately.

[**Evaluation of Socio-Economic Consequences of war :**]{.underline}

This can be done through the use of couple of methods like:

-   using satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) to monitor changes in human activities, such as fossil fuel combustion, power generation, and industrial production, during the conflict. [@ialongo2023]

-   Distinct fire and thermal anomaly patterns due to military activities, contrasting with past agricultural-related fires. These patterns, can be confirmed by Sentinel 2 imagery, carry significant socio-economic implications, straining recovery efforts and requiring resource allocation based on various factors.

-   Satellite data from the VIIRS thermal imager utilization to monitor socio-economic developments, using Total Light Intensity (TLI) serving as an indicator of night illumination, reflecting economic activity, population density, and electricity consumption.

[**Monitor environment and air quality**]{.underline} [@savenets2023]

-   Employing NO2 and CO satellite data, filtering the data fields using a quality assurance index and binned into regular grids for reliability and comparison.

-   Detection of environmental changes: remote sensing enables the identification of alterations in natural settings, including deforestation, water pollution, shifts in vegetation cover, among others, potentially stemming from military activities.

These are several ways in which remotely sensed data can contribute to urban expansion and guide post-war urban planning initiatives to construct a more resilient city.

## Reflection

Conducting research on policies has expanded my understanding of how remote sensing data can drive transformation and development in urban areas, environmental monitoring, and socio-economic analysis. This comprehensive approach underscores the adaptability of remote sensing and the various methods tailored to specific case studies. Despite its potential, remote sensing also poses limitations, such as restricted access to high-resolution data and potential inaccuracies in results. Nonetheless, I firmly believe that leveraging remote sensing methodologies and analyses can inform decision-making processes crucial for national and international development.
