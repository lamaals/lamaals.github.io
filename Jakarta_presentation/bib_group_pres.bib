  abstract = {Land subsidence is natural-anthropogenic hazard affecting several large urban areas in Indonesia, i.e. Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang. Geodetic based results from various techniques (e.g. Leveling, GPS and InSAR) show that land subsidence rates in all three cities generally have spatial and temporal variations, and their magnitude is in average about 5-10 cm/year and can reach up to about 20 cm/year at certain locations and times. This type of silent hazard is mainly caused by the combination of excessive groundwater extraction, natural consolidation of alluvium soil, load of constructions and tectonic activities. In general, information related to characteristics of land subsidence is important for urban spatial planning and development activities, environmental management, and risk assessment efforts. Therefore, systematic and continuous monitoring of land subsidence in urban areas is obviously needed and critical to the welfare of the peoples. Land subsidence impacts in urban areas are quite numerous and can be categorized into infrastructural, environmental, economic and social impacts. In urban areas of Indonesia the subsidence impacts can be seen already in the field in forms of cracking and damage of housing, buildings and infrastructure; wider expansion of (riverine and coastal) flooding areas, malfunction of drainage system, changes in river canal and drain flow systems and increased inland sea water intrusion. In general, land subsidence phenomena will increase the maintenance and rehabilitation costs for the affected environment, buildings and infrastructures. It also badly influences the quality of living environment (e.g. health and sanitation condition) and (social and economic) life in the affected areas. This paper concentrates on the environmental impacts of land subsidence in those three large cities in Indonesia, namely Jakarta, Bandung and Semarang.},

  abstract = {Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia with a population of about 9.6 million people, inhabiting an area of about 660 square-km. In the last three decades, urban development of Jakarta has grown very rapidly in the sectors of industry, trade, transportation, real estate, and many others. This exponentially increased urban development introduces several environmental problems. Land subsidence is one of them. The resulted land subsidence will also then affect the urban development plan and process. It has been reported for many years that several places in Jakarta are subsiding at different rates. The leveling surveys, GPS survey methods, and InSAR measurements have been used to study land subsidence in Jakarta, over the period of 1982--2010. In general, it was found that the land subsidence exhibits spatial and temporal variations, with the rates of about 1--15~cm/year. A few locations can have the subsidence rates up to about 20--28~cm/year. There are four different types of land subsidence that can be expected to occur in the Jakarta basin, namely: subsidence due to groundwater extraction, subsidence induced by the load of constructions (i.e., settlement of high compressibility soil), subsidence caused by natural consolidation of alluvial soil, and tectonic subsidence. It was found that the spatial and temporal variations of land subsidence depend on the corresponding variations of groundwater extraction, coupled with the characteristics of sedimentary layers and building loads above it. In general, there is strong relation between land subsidence and urban development activities in Jakarta.},

  abstract = {Land subsidence is identified as a global problem and intensive studies are being conducted worldwide to detect and monitor risk of this problem. Risk assessment of land subsidence is simply an evaluation of the probability and frequency of occurrence of land subsidence, exposure of people and property to the subsidence and consequence of that exposure. Remote sensing technology was used to extract information of land subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Also, Disaster Risk Index method and Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) along with Geographic Information System (GIS) tools were used to assess risk of land subsidence in Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Subsidence volume for locations Central Kathmandu, Chauni, Lalitpur, Imadol, Thimi, Madhyaour Thimi, New Baneshwor, Koteshwor and Gothatar was calculated using a simple mathematical formula. The subsidence depth for these locations was found to be in a range of 1 cm to 17 cm and the maximum subsidence velocity was found to be 4.8 cm/yr. This study revealed that the location where maximum subsidence was observed (i.e. Central Kathmandu and Lalitpur) was found to be at high risk of experiencing land subsidence induced damage. Other location where subsidence was observed was found to be at medium risk and the rest of the Kathmandu valley was found to be at low risk with current data situation. This study can be considered as the first step towards other comprehensive study relating to land subsidence risk assessment. The outcome of this research provides a basic understanding of the current situation that can further assist in developing prevention and risk management techniques.},

  abstract = {Sea level rise (SLR) is among the most pressing challenges for urban coastal areas. While geocentric (eustatic) SLR receives widespread attention in politics and media, relative SLR at the coast, mainly caused by land subsidence, is still comparatively under-researched despite much higher rates. This paper introduces a combined natural and social science study to bring subsidence more to the forefront of coastal hazard research. We use data from radar altimetry, GNSS controlled tide gauge stations, and InSAR mapping to characterize regional and relative SLR at Jakarta and Semarang Bay, and focus-group discussions and a standardized household survey to analyze risk perceptions and adaptation. Our analysis of InSAR, radar altimetry, and corrected tide gauges clearly identifies subsidence as the major coastal threat in our study areas. The InSAR analysis for Semarang shows stable trends of subsidence up to {\textasciitilde}100 mm/a. For Jakarta, our analysis reveals more complex spatial and temporal patterns with rates around 60 mm/a; revealing significant changes to previous studies. Our analysis of radar altimetry data since 1993 shows a moderate regional SLR of 2.1 mm/a off Semarang and 3.2 mm/a off Jakarta. The InSAR data are integrated into our statistical analysis of household responses towards subsidence. We found, that in contrast to fast-onset events, constantly proceeding subsidence becomes normalized in peoples' perceptions and responses are integrated into day-to-day habits. Thus, risk perception is a far lesser determinant of responses towards subsidence than it is for fast-onset events. Hence, our results relativize former assumptions that risk perception and not actual exposure lead to action. Moreover, we found that local people are not willing to vacate highly exposed areas. Their views need to be included in municipal disaster risk reduction, the urgency of which clearly lies on mitigating subsidence effects rather than on building protection against regionally rising sea levels.},

  abstract = {Land subsidence (LS) is one of the most challenging natural disasters that has potential consequences such as damage to infrastructures and buildings, creating sinkholes, and leading to soil destruction. To mitigate the damages caused by LS, it is necessary to determine the LS-prone areas. In this paper, LS susceptibility was assessed for Kashan Plain in Iran using Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost machine learning algorithms. For the susceptibility analysis, twelve influential factors including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), groundwater drawdown (GWD), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), distance to stream (DtS), distance to road (DtR), distance to fault (DtF), lithology, and land use were taken into account. 291 LS points were used in this study which was divided into two parts of 70\% and 30\% for training and testing the models, respectively. The prediction power of the models and their produced LS susceptibility maps (LSSMs) were validated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), R-Squared (R2), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values. The results showed that the XGBoost had a higher R{$^2$} equal to 0.9032 compared to that of the RF which was equal to 0.8355. XGBoost model had an RMSE equal to 0.3764 cm compared to that of the RF model which was equal to 0.4906 cm. MAE for the XGBoost model was 0.1217 cm and for the RF model was 0.3050 cm. Therefore, the achieved results proved that XGBoost had better performance in this research for predicting LS values based on the measured ones.},

The results show that GSW is not appropriate because the primary factor to Jakarta's sinking is land subsidence, and the GSW can only provide coastal defense. Also, long time construction period to build the GSW; adverse impacts on ecological, hydrodynamic, and socioeconomic aspects; pros and cons related to GSW construction; these factors indicates that Jakarta is not yet ready to build and maintain the GSW, and looking for the other alternative solutions seems required.},

  abstract = {Most published studies identify groundwater extraction as the leading cause of land subsidence (LS). However, the causes of LS are not only attributable to groundwater extraction. Other land-use practices can also affect the occurrence of LS. In this study, radar interferometric techniques and machine learning (ML) models were used for the prediction, susceptibility zoning, and prioritization of influential variables in the occurrence of LS in the Bakhtegan basin. The LS rate was characterized by applying an interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR). The recursive feature elimination (RFE) method was used to detect and select the dominant combination of indicators to prepare an LS susceptibility map. Three ML models, including random forest (RF), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and classification and regression trees (CART), were used to develop predictive models. All three models had acceptable performance. Among the ML models, the RF model performed the best (i.e., Nash--Sutcliffe efficiency, Kling--Gupta efficiency, correlation coefficient, and percent bias metrics of 0.76, 0.78, 0.88, and 0.70 for validating phase, respectively). The analysis conducted on all three ML model outputs showed that high and very high LS susceptibility classes were located on or near irrigated agricultural land. The results indicate that the leading cause of land LS in the study region is not due to groundwater withdrawals. Instead, the distance from dams and the proximity to anticlines, faults, and mines are the most important identifiers of LS susceptibility. Additionally, the highest probability of LS susceptibility was found at distances less than 18 km from synclines, 6 to 13 km from anticlines, 23 km from dams, and distances less than 20 to more than 144 km from mines. The validated methods presented in this study are reproducible, transferrable, and recommended for mapping LS susceptibility in semiarid and arid climate zones with similar environmental conditions.},

In places along island coasts where shoreline recession is particularly noticeable and/or its impacts most severe, perhaps because adjacent population densities are unusually high, a common response has been to build a seawall. While this solution may appear instinctively correct, studies suggest otherwise, even to the point where seawall construction, particularly outside urban areas, might be considered maladaptive -- neither solving the intended problem in the short-term nor helping coastal peoples cope effectively with longer-term shoreline change. Seawall construction can be viewed as part of a broader group of maladaptive solutions that are uncritically embraced by island peoples who may judge the efficacy of these solutions by their success in (wealthier) continental or urban contexts. More effective and sustainable approaches involve nature-based solutions in the short term and planning for transformative responses involving relocation in the longer term.},

  abstract = {Although the special region of Jakarta Province (DKI Jakarta), Indonesia, has a large population of 10.9 million, piped water coverage remains at only 64\%. Therefore, excessive groundwater abstraction has caused serious land subsidence over the last few decades. This study proposed the priority areas for piped water supply extension to alleviate the adverse effects of groundwater over-abstraction in DKI Jakarta. Water consumption and multilayer analyses (e.g., geology, groundwater abstraction, groundwater level, piped water coverage, and groundwater quality) were carried out to determine the priority areas for piped water development. Based on three parameters, namely the water demand--supply gap, land subsidence, and groundwater quality, the northern and western regions of Jakarta were selected as the priority areas for piped water development, followed by the southern and eastern regions. The demand for piped water by the population in the abovementioned priority areas is estimated to be 462,211 m3/d, while the total water demand of Jakarta is 1,878,899 m3/d, which is greater than the supply capacity of 1,747,440 m3/d from the existing water treatment plants. Therefore, the areas for controlled groundwater abstraction were also selected to augment the shortfall of the piped water supply capacity.},
